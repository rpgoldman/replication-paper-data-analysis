# Data analysis for paper "Highly-Automated, High-Throughput Replication of Yeast-based Logic Circuit Design Assessments"

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for analyzing data underlying this paper, which is [available on Biorxiv](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.31.493627).  The matching data are at Zenodo, at the DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6562250

This project is still a work in progress, as I make sure that it's clear how to trace the figures and tables in the paper can be traced back to specific Jupyter notebooks and even specific cells.
